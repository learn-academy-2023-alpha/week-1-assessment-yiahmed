# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a version control software that allows for the modifying, and tracking of files which can be stored to branches or a main branch. Github is the cloud in which these can be uploaded and kept. Files can then be pulled from Github onto your local and worked on a pushed back onto Github allowing you to access your repositories from anywhere.

Researched answer: Git is a software while github is a service. Git allows you to keep track of your source code history and is installed locally on a system. Github is a gui that is hosted on the web allowing users to manage git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and BANG (!) operators will return a Boolean value when used.

Researched answer: Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to determine logic between values and variables, they return Boolean values when used.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the place of a value in an array while a value is the actual "value" at that index. For example in the array, yahya = [yahya, ahmed] the index of yahya is 0 but the value is yahya

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: A string is a type of variable while an array is a variable that can hold multiple values such as strings. Arrays are similar to strings because they both have indexes but they are also different in that sense because arrays are 0 index while strings are not.

Researched answer: Arrays and strings are both data structures used to store collections of values. Both arrays and strings can be indexed, meaning you can access individual elements of either structure by referring to their position in the collection. Arrays can store any type of data, whereas strings are typically used to store text data.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: There are two different positions given to the pair in pair programming. One is the driver meaning they are coding out everything and the other is the navigator meaning they guide the driver on what to code according to the instructions. Driver and navigators can switch between positions freely but its encourage that each person gives each position a try.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a collaborative software development technique in which two developers work together on the same task, sharing a single workstation. The driver is the developer who is actively typing the code on the computer while he navigator is the developer who is responsible for reviewing the code as it is written, looking for bugs and making suggestions.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result.

2. Jest: Jest is a powerful and user-friendly testing framework that can help developers write high quality, reliable JavaScript code. It is widely used for testing applications written in JavaScript, particularly React applications.

3. Objects: An object is a collection of key value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any valid JavaScript data type, including other objects.

4. Method: Methods are described as a property of an object.

5. Classes: Classes are a way to create object blueprints that define the properties and behavior of a particular type of object.
